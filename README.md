# Introduction

This project is the final challenge of the DEV QUEST course, where the objective is to create a single page application (SPA) fetching information from the POKEMON API, using the following technologies:

* REACT (Function components with hooks);
* Context API;
* React Router DOM;
* Styled Components;
* JEST;
# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
# Challenges

It was very challenging working with hooks, and state changing components with async functions. 
I really appreciate all the help I had from my teachers and colleagues, without them I wouldn't have gone so far.
